# gRINN Collaborative Development - ISMB/ECCB 2025 CollaborationFest

**Advancing Protein Energy Network Analysis through Community Contributions**

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This CollaborationFest project focuses on enhancing and expanding [**gRINN**](https://github.com/osercinoglu/grinn) (get Residue Interaction eNergies and Networks), a tool for calculating residue interaction energies and constructing protein energy networks from molecular dynamics simulations. We invite bioinformaticians, computational biologists, and MD simulation enthusiasts to join us in testing, improving, and documenting this resource for the structural biology community.

### About gRINN
gRINN is a comprehensive Python-based tool that:
- Calculates pairwise amino acid non-bonded interaction energies from GROMACS MD trajectories
- Constructs Protein Energy Networks (PENs) with customizable energy cutoffs
- Performs betweenness centrality analysis to identify key residues in protein communication pathways
- Provides an interactive web dashboard for visualization and analysis
- Supports Docker containerization for reproducible analysis

## üöÄ Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Tool Testing & Validation**: Test gRINN with diverse protein systems and simulation datasets
2. **Bug Identification & Fixes**: Identify and resolve issues encountered during real-world usage
3. **Tutorial Development**: Create comprehensive tutorials and documentation for different use cases
4. **Feature Enhancement**: Implement new features based on community feedback and needs
5. **Performance Optimization**: Improve computational efficiency and scalability

### Quick Setup

#### Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/osercinoglu/grinn-ismb-2025.git
cd grinn-ismb-2025

# Build Docker image
docker build -t grinn .

# Run with sample data
docker run -p 8051:8051 grinn dashboard test
```

#### Using Conda
